Revision history for Perl extension Moose

0.35
    * Moose::Meta::Method::Constructor
      - fix to make sure even Class::MOP attributes 
        are handled correctly (Thanks to Dave Rolsky)
        - added test for this

0.34 Mon. Jan. 21, 2008
    ~~~ more misc. doc. fixes ~~~
    ~~ updated copyright dates ~~

    Moose is now a postmodern object system :)
      - (see the POD for details)

    * <<Role System Refactoring>>
    - this release contains a major reworking and
      cleanup of the role system
      - 100% backwards compat.
      - Role application now restructured into seperate
        classes based on type of applicants
      - Role summation (combining of more than one role)
        is much cleaner and anon-classes are no longer
        used in this process
      - new Composite role metaclass
      - runtime application of roles to instances
        is now more efficient and re-uses generated
        classes when applicable

    * <<New Role composition features>>
      - methods can now be excluded from a given role
        during composition

            with 'My::Role' => { excludes => [qw/method1 method2/] };

      - methods can now be aliased to another name (and
        still retain the original as well)

            with 'My::Role' => { 
                alias => {
                    method1 => method1_aliased
                }
            };
            
    * <<New Attribute traits>>
      - allows arbitrary roles to be applied to attribute metaobjects
        to allow better combination of custom attribute features. Docs
        are coming soon for this feature.

    * <<New Maybe[$type] parameterized type>>
      - added this new type which basically means the value is 
        of $type or it is undef

    ====

    * Moose
      Moose::Role
      - now uses the Moose::Util::apply_all_roles to deal
        with role application

    * Moose::Util
      - added the &apply_all_roles function

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - all optimized type constraint subs are now
        pulled from the Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::OptimizedConstraints
        module (thanks to nothingmuch)
      - improved support for the IO:: family of modules within the
        FileHandle type constraint
    
    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::OptimizedConstraints
      - added this module (see above)

    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - fixed the &_process_attribute method to be called
        by &add_attribute, so that the API is now correct

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor
      - fixed bug when passing a list of values to
        an accessor would get (incorrectly) ignored.
        Thanks to Sartak for finding this ;)
        - added tests for this (Sartak again)

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor
      Moose::Meta::Method::Constructor
      Moose::Meta::Attribute
      Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion
      - lots of cleanup of such things as:
        - generated methods
        - type constraint handling
        - error handling/messages
        (thanks to nothingmuch)
    
    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Parameterizable
      - added this module to support the refactor 
        in Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Parameterized

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Parameterized
      - refactored how these types are handled so they 
        are more generic and not confined to ArrayRef
        and HashRef only

    * t/
      - shortened some file names for better VMS support (RT #32381)

0.33 Fri. Dec. 14, 2007
    !! Moose now loads 2 x faster !!
    !!  with new Class::MOP 0.49  !!

    ++ new oose.pm module to make command line
       Moose-ness easier (see POD docs for more)

    * Moose::Meta::Class
    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - several tweaks to take advantage of the
        new method map caching in Class::MOP

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Parameterized
      - allow subtypes of ArrayRef and HashRef to
        be used as a container (sartak)
        - added tests for this
      - basic support for coercion to ArrayRef and
        HashRef for containers (sartak)
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion
      - coercions will now create subtypes as needed
        so you can now add coercions to parameterized
        types without having to explictly define them
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor
      - allow subclasses to decide whether we need
        to copy the value into a new variable (sartak)

0.32 Tues. Dec. 4, 2007
    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - fixing how subtype aliases of unions work
        they should inherit the parent's coercion
        - added tests for this
      - you can now define multiple coercions on
        a single type at different times instead of
        having to do it all in one place
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      - there is now a default constraint of sub { 1 }
        instead of Moose::Util::TypeConstraints setting
        this for us

    * Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion
    * Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion::Union
      - added the &has_coercion_for_type and
        &add_type_coercions methods to support the
        new features above (although you cannot add
        more type coercions for Union types)

0.31 Mon. Nov. 26, 2007
    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - made the +attr syntax handle extending types with
        parameters. So "has '+foo' => (isa => 'ArrayRef[Int]')"
        now works if the original foo is an ArrayRef.
        - added tests for this.
      - delegation now works even if the attribute does not
        have a reader method using the get_read_method_ref
        method from Class::MOP::Attribute.
        - added tests for this
        - added docs for this

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - passing no "additional attribute info" to
        &find_or_create_type_constraint will no longer
        attempt to create an __ANON__ type for you,
        instead it will just return undef.
        - added docs for this

0.30 Fri. Nov. 23, 2007
    * Moose::Meta::Method::Constructor
      -builder related bug in inlined constructor. (groditi)

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor
      - genereate unnecessary calls to predicates and refactor
        code generation for runtime speed (groditi)

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - fix ClassName constraint to introspect symbol table (mst)
        - added more tests for this (mst)
      - fixed it so that subtype 'Foo' => as 'HashRef[Int]' ...
        with work correctly.
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Cookbook
      - adding the link to Recipie 11 (written by Sartak)
        - adding test for SYNOPSIS code

    * t/
      - New tests for builder bug. Upon instantiation, if an
        attribute had a builder, no value and was not lazy the
        builder default was not getting run, oops. (groditi)

0.29 Tues. Nov. 13, 2007
    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - Fix error message on missing builder method (groditi)

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor
      - Fix error message on missing builder method (groditi)

      - Add test to check for the correct error message when
        builder method is missing (groditi)

0.28 Tues. Nov. 13, 2007
    - 0.27 packaged incorrectly (groditi)

0.27 Tues. Nov. 13, 2007
    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - Added support for the new builder option (groditi)
      - Added support for lazy_build option (groditi)
      - Changed slot initialization for predicate changes (groditi)

      - Fix inline methods to work with corrected predicate
        behavior (groditi)

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Constructor
      - Added support for lazy_build option (groditi)

    * t/
      - tests for builder and lazy_build (groditi)

    * fixing some misc. bits in the docs that
      got mentioned on CPAN Forum & perlmonks

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - fixed how required methods are handled
        when they encounter overriden or modified
        methods from a class (thanks to confound).
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraint
      - fixed the type notation parser so that
        the | always creates a union and so is
        no longer a valid type char (thanks to
        konobi, mugwump and #moose for working
        this one out.)
        - added more tests for this

0.26 Thurs. Sept. 27, 2007
    == New Features ==

    * Parameterized Types
      We now support parameterized collection types, such as:
          ArrayRef[Int]    # array or integers
          HashRef[Object]  # a hash with object values
      They can also be nested:
          ArrayRef[HashRef[RegExpr]] # an array of hashes with regexpr values
      And work with the type unions as well:
          ArrayRef[Int | Str]  # array of integers of strings

    * Better Framework Extendability
      Moose.pm is now "extendable" such that it is now much
      easier to extend the framework and add your own keywords
      and customizations. See the "EXTENDING AND EMBEDDING MOOSE"
      section of the Moose.pm docs.

    * Moose Snacks!
      In an effort to begin documenting some of the various
      details of Moose as well as some common idioms, we have
      created Moose::Cookbook::Snacks as a place to find
      small (easily digestable) nuggets of Moose code.

    ====
    ~ Several doc updates/cleanup thanks to castaway ~

    - converted build system to use Module::Install instead of
      Module::Build (thanks to jrockway)

    * Moose
      - added all the meta classes to the immutable list and
        set it to inline the accessors

      - exposed and documented init_meta() to allow better
	    embedding and extending of Moose (perigrin)

	* t/
	  - complete re-organization of the test suite
	  - added some new tests as well
	  - finally re-enabled the Moose::POOP test since
	    the new version of DBM::Deep now works again
	    (thanks rob)

    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - fixed very odd and very nasty recursion bug with
        inner/augment (mst)

      - fixed issue with generated accessor code making
        assumptions about hash based classes (thanks to dexter)

    * Moose::Coookbook::Snacks
      - these are bits of documentation, not quite as big as
        Recipes but which have no clear place in the module docs.
        So they are Snacks! (horray for castaway++)

    * Moose::Cookbook::Recipe4
      - updated it to use the new ArrayRef[MyType] construct
        - updated the accompanying test as well

    +++ Major Refactor of the Type Constraint system +++
    +++       with new features added as well        +++

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraint
      - no longer uses package variable to keep track of
        the type constraints, now uses the an instance of
        Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry to do it

        (thanks to mugwump)
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      - some minor adjustments to make subclassing easier
      - added the package_defined_in attribute so that we
        can track where the type constraints are created

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union
      - this is now been refactored to be a subclass of
        Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint

    * Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion::Union
      - this has been added to service the newly refactored
        Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union and is itself
        a subclass of Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Parameterized
      - added this module (taken from MooseX::AttributeHelpers)
        to help construct nested collection types
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry
      - added this class to keep track of type constraints

0.25 Mon. Aug. 13, 2007
    * Moose
      - Documentation update to reference Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
        under 'isa' in 'has' for how to define a new type
        (thanks to shlomif).

    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - required attributes now will no longer accept undef
        from the constructor, even if there is a default and lazy

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union
      - added (has_)hand_optimized_constraint to this class so that
        it behaves as the regular Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint does.

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - large refactoring of this code
      - added several more tests
        - tests for subtle conflict resolition issues
          added, but not currently running
          (thanks to kolibre)

    * Moose::Cookbook::Recipe7
      - added new recipe for augment/inner functionality
        (still in progress)
        - added test for this

    * Moose::Spec::Role
      - a formal definition of roles (still in progress)

    * Moose::Util
      - utilities for easier working with Moose classes
        - added tests for these

0.24 Tues. July 3, 2007
    ~ Some doc updates/cleanup ~

    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - added support for roles to be given as parameters
        to the 'handles' option.
        - added tests and docs for this
      - the has '+foo' attribute form now accepts changes to
        the lazy option, and the addition of a handles option
        (but not changing the handles option)
        - added tests and docs for this

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - required methods are now fetched using find_method_by_name
        so that required methods can come from superclasses
        - adjusted tests for this

0.23 Mon. June 18, 2007
    * Moose::Meta::Method::Constructor
      - fix inlined constructor for hierarchy with multiple BUILD methods (mst)
    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - Modify make_immutable to work with the new Class::MOP immutable
        mechanism + POD + very basic test (groditi)
    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - Fix handles to use goto() so that caller() comes out properly on
        the other side (perigrin)

0.22 Thurs. May 31, 2007
    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - fix for prototype undeclared issue when Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
        loaded before consumers (e.g. Moose::Meta::Attribute) by predeclaring
        prototypes for functions
      - added the ClassName type constraint, this checks for strings
        which will respond true to ->isa(UNIVERSAL).
        - added tests and docs for this
      - subtyping just in name now works correctly by making the
        default for where be { 1 }
        - added test for this

        merlyn for finding this bug
        - tests added for this
      - fix reader presedence bug in Moose::Meta::Attribute + tests

    * Moose::Object
      - Foo->new(undef) now gets ignored, it is assumed you meant to pass
        a HASH-ref and missed. This produces better error messages then
        having it die cause undef is not a HASH.
        - added tests for this

0.21 Thursday, May 2nd, 2007
    * Moose
      - added SUPER_SLOT and INNER_SLOT class hashes to support unimport
      - modified unimport to remove super and inner along with the rest
        - altered unimport tests to handle this

    * Moose::Role
      - altered super export to populate SUPER_SLOT

    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - altered augment and override modifier application to use *_SLOT
        - modified tests for these to unimport one test class each to test

      - fixed issue where custom attribute metaclasses
        where not handled correctly in roles
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - fixed issue where extending metaclasses with
        roles would blow up. Thanks to Aankhen`` for
        finding this insidious error, and it's solution.

    ~~ lots of spelling and grammer fixes in the docs,
       many many thanks to rlb3 and Aankhen for these :)

0.20 Friday, April 6th, 2007
    >> I messed up the SKIP logic in one test
       so this release is just to fix that.

    * Moose
      - 'has' now also accepts an ARRAY ref
        to create multiple attrs (see docs)
        (thanks to konobi for this)
         - added tests and docs

0.19 Thurs. April 5th, 2007
    ~~ More documentation updates ~~

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - 'type' now supports messages as well
        thanks to phaylon for finding this
        - added tests for this
      - added &list_all_type_constraints and
        &list_all_builtin_type_constraints
        functions to facilitate introspection.

    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - fixed regexp 'handles' declarations
        to build the list of delegated methods
        correctly (and not override important
        things like &new) thanks to ashleyb
        for finding this
        - added tests and docs for this
      - added the 'documentation' attributes
        so that you can actually document your
        attributes and inspect them through the
        meta-object.
        - added tests and docs for this

    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - when loading custom attribute metaclasses
        it will first look in for the class in the
        Moose::Meta::Attribute::Custom::$name, and
        then default to just loading $name.
        - added tests and docs for this

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      - type constraints now stringify to their names.
        - added test for this

    * misc.
      - added tests to assure we work with Module::Refresh
      - added stricter test skip logic in the Moose POOP
        test, ask Rob Kinyon why.
        - *cough* DBM::Deep 1.0 backwards compatability sucks *cough* ;)

0.18 Sat. March 10, 2007
    ~~ Many, many documentation updates ~~

    * misc.
      - We now use Class::MOP::load_class to
        load all classes.
      - added tests to show types and subtypes
        working with Declare::Constraints::Simple
        and Test::Deep as constraint engines.

0.18_001
    !! You must have Class::MOP 0.37_001  !!
    !! for this developer release to work !!

    This release was primarily adding the immutable
    feature to Moose. An immutable class is one which
    you promise not to alter. When you set the class
    as immutable it will perform various bits of
    memoization and inline certain part of the code
    (constructors, destructors and accessors). This
    minimizes (and in some cases totally eliminates)
    one of Moose's biggest performance hits. This
    feature is not on by default, and is 100% optional.
    It has several configurable bits as well, so you
    can pick and choose to your specific needs.

    The changes involved in this were fairly wide and
    highly specific, but 100% backwards compatible, so
    I am not going to enumerate them here. If you are
    truely interested in what was changed, please do
    a diff :)

0.17 Tues. Nov. 14, 2006
    * Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor
      - bugfix for read-only accessors which
        are have a type constraint and lazy.
        Thanks to chansen for finding it.

0.16 Tues. Nov. 14, 2006
    ++ NOTE ++
    There are some speed improvements in this release,
    but they are only the begining, so stay tuned.

    * Moose::Object
      - BUILDALL and DEMOLISHALL no longer get
        called unless they actually need to be.
        This gave us a signifigant speed boost
        for the cases when there is no BUILD or
        DEMOLISH method present.

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      - added an 'optimize_as' option to the
        type constraint, which allows for a
        hand optimized version of the type
        constraint to be used when possible.
      - Any internally created type constraints
        now provide an optimized version as well.

0.15 Sun. Nov. 5, 2006
    ++ NOTE ++
    This version of Moose *must* have Class::MOP 0.36 in order
    to work correctly. A number of small internal tweaks have
    been made in order to be compatible with that release.

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - added &unimport so that you can clean out
        your class namespace of these exported
        keywords

    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - fixed minor issue which occasionally
        comes up during global destruction
        (thanks omega)
      - moved Moose::Meta::Method::Overriden into
        its own file.

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - moved Moose::Meta::Role::Method into
        its own file.

    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - changed how we do type checks so that
        we reduce the overall cost, but still
        retain correctness.
       *** API CHANGE ***
      - moved accessor generation methods to
        Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor to
        conform to the API changes from
        Class::MOP 0.36

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      - changed how constraints are compiled
        so that we do less recursion and more
        iteration. This makes the type check
        faster :)
      - moved Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union
        into its own file

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor
      - created this from methods formerly found in
        Moose::Meta::Attribute

    * Moose::Meta::Role::Method
      - moved this from Moose::Meta::Role

    * Moose::Meta::Method::Overriden

0.14 Mon. Oct. 9, 2006

    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - fixed lazy attributes which were not getting
        checked with the type constraint (thanks ashley)
        - added tests for this
      - removed the over-enthusiastic DWIMery of the
        automatic ArrayRef and HashRef defaults, it
        broke predicates in an ugly way.
        - removed tests for this

0.13 Sat. Sept. 30, 2006
    ++ NOTE ++
    This version of Moose *must* have Class::MOP 0.35 in order
    to work correctly. A number of small internal tweaks have
    been made in order to be compatible with that release.

    * Moose
      - Removed the use of UNIVERSAL::require to be a better
        symbol table citizen and remove a dependency
        (thanks Adam Kennedy)

      **~~ removed experimental & undocumented feature ~~**
      - commented out the 'method' and 'self' keywords, see the
        comments for more info.

    * Moose::Cookbook
      - added a FAQ and WTF files to document frequently
        asked questions and common problems

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - added GlobRef and FileHandle type constraint
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - if your attribute 'isa' ArrayRef of HashRef, and you have
        not explicitly set a default, then make the default DWIM.
        This will also work for subtypes of ArrayRef and HashRef
        as well.
      - you can now auto-deref subtypes of ArrayRef or HashRef too.
        - new test added for this (thanks to ashley)

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - added basic support for runtime role composition
        but this is still *highly experimental*, so feedback
        is much appreciated :)
        - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      - the type constraint now handles the coercion process
        through delegation, this is to support the coercion
        of unions

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union
      - it is now possible for coercions to be performed
        on a type union
        - added tests for this (thanks to konobi)

    * Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion
      - properly capturing error when type constraint
        is not found

    * Build.PL
      - Scalar::Util 1.18 is bad on Win32, so temporarily
        only require version 1.17 for Win32 and cygwin.
        (thanks Adam Kennedy)

0.12 Sat. Sept. 1, 2006
    * Moose::Cookbook
      - Recipe5 (subtypes & coercion) has been written

    * Moose
      - fixed "bad meta" error message to be more descriptive
      - fixed &unimport to not remove the &inner and &super
        keywords because we need to localize them.
      - fixed number of spelling/grammer issues, thanks Theory :)

      **~~ experimental & undocumented feature ~~**
      - added the method and self keywords, they are basically
        just sugar, and they may not stay around.

    * Moose::Object
      - added &dump method to easily Data::Dumper
        an object

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
      - added the &is_a_type_of method to check both the current
        and the subtype of a method (similar to &isa with classes)

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - this is now a subclass of Class::MOP::Module, and no longer
        creates the _role_meta ugliness of before.
        - fixed tests to reflect this change

0.11 Wed. July 12, 2006
    * Moose
      - added an &unimport method to remove all the keywords
        that Moose will import, simply add 'no Moose' to the
        bottom of your class file.

    * t/
      - fixed some test failures caused by a forgotten test
        dependency.

0.10 Thurs. July 6, 2006
    * Moose
      - improved error message when loading modules so
        it is less confusing when you load a role.
      - added &calculate_all_roles method to
        Moose::Meta::Class and Moose::Meta::Role

    NOTE:
    This module has been tested against Class::MOP 0.30
    but it does not yet utilize the optimizations
    it makes available. Stay tuned for that ;)

0.09_03 Fri. June 23, 2006
    ++ DEVELOPER RELEASE ++
    * Moose
      - 'use strict' and 'use warnings' are no longer
         needed in Moose classes, Moose itself will
         turn them on for you.
         - added tests for this
      - moved code from exported subs to private methods
        in Moose::Meta::Class

    * Moose::Role
      - as with Moose, strict and warnings are
        automatically turned on for you.
         - added tests for this

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - now handles an edge case for override errors
        - added tests for this
      - added some more edge case tests

0.09_02 Tues. May 16, 2006
    ++ DEVELOPER RELEASE ++
    * Moose
      - added prototypes to the exported subs
      - updated docs

    * Moose::Role
      - added prototypes to the exported subs

      - cleaned up prototypes for the subs
      - updated docs

0.09_01 Fri. May 12, 2006
    ++ DEVELOPER RELEASE ++
      - This release works in combination with
        Class::MOP 0.29_01, it is a developer
        release because it uses the a new
        instance sub-protocol and a fairly
        complete Role implementation. It has
        not yet been optimized, so it slower
        the the previous CPAN version. This
        release also lacks good updated docs,
        the official release will have updated docs.

    * Moose
      - refactored the keyword exports
        - 'with' now checks Role validaity and
          accepts more than one Role at a time
        - 'extends' makes metaclass adjustments as
           needed to ensure metaclass compatability

    * Moose::Role
      - refactored the keyword exports
        - 'with' now checks Role validaity and
          accepts more than one Role at a time

    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - added the 'enum' keyword for simple
        string enumerations which can be used as
        type constraints
        - see example of usage in t/202_example.t

    * Moose::Object
      - more careful checking of params to new()

    * Moose::Meta::Role
      - much work done on the role composition
        - many new tests for conflict detection
          and composition edge cases
        - not enough documentation, I suggest
          looking at the tests

    * Moose::Meta::Instance
      - added new Instance metaclass to support
        the new Class::MOP instance protocol

    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - some small changes to support the new
        instance protocol
      - some small additions to support Roles

    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - some improvements to the accessor generation code
        by nothingmuch
      - some small changes to support the new
        instance protocol
      - (still somewhat) experimental delegation support
        with the 'handles' option
        - added several tests for this
        - no docs for this yet

0.05 Thurs. April 27, 2006
    * Moose
      - keywords are now exported with Sub::Exporter
        thanks to chansen for this commit
      - has keyword now takes a 'metaclass' option
        to support custom attribute meta-classes
        on a per-attribute basis
        - added tests for this
      - the 'has' keyword not accepts inherited slot
        specifications (has '+foo'). This is still an
        experimental feature and probably not finished
        see t/038_attribute_inherited_slot_specs.t for
        more details, or ask about it on #moose

        being reported
        - added test for this
